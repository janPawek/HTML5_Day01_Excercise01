   <h2><b>What is HTML?</b></h2>
   <div>HTML is the HyperText Markup Language used to describe web pages. HyperText is what you use daily to move around on the web — by clicking on certain elements called hyperlinks which direct your browser to the next page. The word “hyper” just means it does not function linearly — meaning you can go to any place on the internet from any other place — which is what allows the modern internet as we know it to function.

    HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language. Markup is used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. A web page consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose or mark up different parts of the content (like page title, or paragraphs) to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
    
    
    HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author — these are the elements.</div>

   <h2>What are HTML elements? What is the difference between opening and closing tags?</h2>
   <div>Tags are used to define where an HTML element starts and ends. A start (opening) tag is made up of an opening angle bracket (< ) followed by the name of the element, one or more space separated attribute/value pairs, and for the end (closing) tag a closing angle bracket ( >). The end tag consists of a forward slash (/) written before the element name.
    Everything between start and end tag is the content of an element.
    HTML tags normally come in pairs like <p> and </p> - the first tag in a pair is the start opening tag, the second tag is the end tag.
    <br>
    The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag. Most HTML tags come in such pairs, though there are exceptions called "self closing tags" or “void elements”

   <h2>What is an HTML block element?</h2>
   <div>In HTML, block-level elements are elements that create a "block" on the page, meaning they typically start on a new line and extend the full width of their container. Block-level elements are used to structure the layout and organization of content on a web page. Common examples of block-level elements include:
    <div>: The <div> element is a generic container that is often used to group other elements and apply styles or scripts to them collectively.
    <p>: The <p> element represents a paragraph of text. Paragraphs are block-level elements, and each <p> element typically starts on a new line.
    <h1> to <h6>: These are header elements, with <h1> being the largest and <h6> the smallest. They are used to define headings in a document.
    <ul>, <ol>, <li>: The unordered list (<ul>), ordered list (<ol>), and list item (<li>) elements are used to create lists. Both <ul> and <ol> are block-level, while <li> is an inline-level element.
    <div>: The <div> element is a versatile container that is often used to group and structure content. It is a block-level element.
    <table>, <tr>, <td>: These elements are used to create tables. The <table> is a block-level element, while <tr> (table row) and <td> (table data/cell) are inline-level within the context of the table.
    <form>: The <form> element is used to create HTML forms. It is a block-level element.
    <hr>: The <hr> element represents a horizontal rule or line, typically used to separate content. It is a block-level element.    Block-level elements are generally used for larger structural elements on a webpage, and they help define the overall layout and organization of the content. They create distinct blocks that stack vertically, contributing to the visual hierarchy of the page. When using CSS, you can manipulate the layout and styling of block-level elements more extensively than inline-level elements.</div>
   <br>
   <h2>What is an HTML inline element?</h2>
   <div>The inline element doesn't start on a new line, it only uses as much space as is necessary. A link is an example of an inline element. In general inline elements cannot contain block-level elements but they may contain other inline elements. An exception is the link <a> inline element which can contain a block-level element such as div. Regarding the block-level elements, they can include other block-level elements, as well as inline elements. 
    Below you can find some of the HTML elements categorized as block-level and inline elements.</div>

   <h2>What is the div tag and why is it important? What is the difference between div and span elements?</h2>

   <h2>What is the purpose of semantic elements in HTML5?</h2>
   <div>A semantic element clearly describes its “meaning” to both the browser as well as to the developer, and is “better” handled by search engines.</div>
